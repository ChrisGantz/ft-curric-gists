# First AJAX Project

### Walkthrough - Without Modules

Let's get our app working using a simple single-file approach to focus on practicing making AJAX calls and placing the data in the DOM.

[Clone this Repo](https://github.com/rich-at-thinkful/first-ajax-no-modules) and complete the tasks listed in the `index.js`.

**Only when you've finished**, move on to the [walkthrough with modules](first-ajax-with-modules.md).
